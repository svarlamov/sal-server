# Speak and Listen
Speak and Listen is a comprehensive language assessment system that provides educators with the tools necessary to test students on their lingual knowledge. A versatile system, Speak and Listen, was initially developed to allow for simple long-distance evaluations, as is often the case with entrance and placement exams, however it is by no means limited to this use case. Speak and Listen is useful for all sorts of examinations where audio and or video are required to get the full picture of a student’s success. Previously, conducting these sorts of exams used to take hours, meeting with students in-person, or even arranging long-distance video calls, but Speak and Listen makes it as easy as creating an exam, sharing the exam, and then grading the responses whenever you have the time! Best of all, Speak and Listen requires nothing more than a camera/microphone, an internet connection, and a web browser. That’s right, no Adobe FlashPlayer, no native installations, and no other annoying software!
